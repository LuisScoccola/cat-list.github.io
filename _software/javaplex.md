The JavaPlex library is a persistent homology package for a variety of complexes.
From the docs:

- Computation of persistent homology of filtered complexes over the fields Z/pZ and Q
- Automated construction of Vietoris-Rips, witness, and lazy-witness complexes from finite metric spaces
- Construction of CW-complexes and the computation of their persistent homology
- Computation of zigzag persistence of "incremental" zigzag complexes
- Homological operations such as tensor and hom of complexes
