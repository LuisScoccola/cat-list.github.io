KeplerMapper is an implementation of the Mapper algorithm in Python.
KeplerMapper provides a hypercube covering scheme although other schemes can be user supplied.
The package also provides an interactive visualisation of the Mapper graph
as an HTML file, and can produce matplotlib and Plotly visualisations.
