Perseus is a persistent homology package using discrete Morse theory. 
Used as a stand-alone executable, Perseus accepts a text file describing the complex and filtration
of several complex types including:

- sparse or dense cubical grids
- simplicial complexes with uniform or non-uniform top-level simplex information
- Vietoris-Rips from a distance matrix, or uniform or non-uniform birth point information
