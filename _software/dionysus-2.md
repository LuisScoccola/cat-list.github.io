From the docs:
> Dionysus 2 is the second incarnation of the library [[Dionysus]](/software/dionysus.html) for computing persistent homology.
> As before, it’s written in C++, with Python bindings.
> * Cleaner, more consistent internal design (for example, all algorithms support arbitrary fields).
> * Some new algorithms, e.g., Omni-field Persistence and Wasserstein and bottleneck distance computation from Hera.
> * A few Plotting routines, based on Matplotlib.
> * Better integration with NumPy.
> 
> Features that haven’t (yet) made it over from Dionysus 1 include vineyards.
