Giotto-TDA is a well-tested suite of computational topology tools, compatible with the `scikit-learn` API and framework.
From the docs:
> giotto-tda is a high performance topological machine learning toolbox in Python built on top of scikit-learn and is distributed under the GNU AGPLv3 license.
> It is part of the Giotto family of open-source projects.

Supported data types include:
* point clouds,
* tabular data,
* time series data
* (directed) graphs,
* images.

Supported filtrations include:
* (weighted/sparse) Vietoris-Rips,
* weak alpha filtration,
* euclidean ÄŒech filtration, 
* filtered cubical complexes,
* (un)directed flag complex filtrations.

Persistence diagrams can also be converted into other representations including persistence landscapes, persistence images and Betti curves.
In line with the `scikit-learn` framework, preprocessing, persistent homology and diagram representations can be combined into a single pipeline.

Under the hood, many demanding workloads are implemented in C++, vectorised and parallelised.
