Persistent and stable clustering (Persistable) is a density-based clustering algorithm intended for exploratory data analysis. What distinguishes Persistable from other clustering algorithms is its visualization capabilities. Persistable's interactive mode lets you visualize multi-scale and multi-density cluster structure present in the data. This is used to guide the choice of parameters that lead to the final clustering. Persistable is based on multi-parameter persistence, a method from topological data analysis.
